  # The input_number integration allows the user to define values that can be
  # controlled via the frontend and can be used within conditions of automation.
  #
  # The frontend can display a slider, or a numeric input box. Changes to the
  # slider or numeric input box generate state events. These state events can be
  # utilized as automation triggers as well.

  # I don't store my input number entities in my YAML configuration,
  # instead I manage them via the Home Assistant frontend.
