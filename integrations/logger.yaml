  # The logger integration lets you define the level of logging activities
  # in Home Assistant.
  #
  # I use this to reduce error messages for specific things,
  # so I can focus on log messages that matter to me.

    default: warning
    logs:
      # For when I experience slow startups
      # I can enable this to check out what is going on

      # Honestly, Z-Wave + Home Assistant: not so good.
      # Hopefully it will be better when this all gets replaced
      # Until that time, I'm not interested in warnings.
