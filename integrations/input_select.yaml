  # The input_select integration allows the user to define a list of values that
  # can be selected via the frontend and can be used within conditions of
  # automation.
  #
  # When a user selects a new item, a state transition event is generated.
  # This state event can be used in an automation trigger.

  # I don't store my input select entities in my YAML configuration,
  # instead I manage them via the Home Assistant frontend.
