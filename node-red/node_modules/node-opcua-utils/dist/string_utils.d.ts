 *
 * lowerFirstLetter convert a OPCUA Identifier to a javascript Identifier
 *
 * @summary
 *
 *  OPCUA and Javascript use two different rules to build identifiers.
 *
 *  OPCUA Identifier usually starts with a upper case letter and word are join together, this is known as
 *  the Pascal case, or CapitalizedWords convention.  (for instance HelloWorld)
 *  But sometime, OPCUA indentifiers do not follow this convention strictly and we can find various
 *  other convention being applied such as underscore between word, or addintion of ACRONYMED prefixes.
 *  On it's own, this causes great confusion and inconsistancy in programming style.
 *
 *  Javascritpt uses a slightly different convention called camelCase where word are joined together
 *  and inner words starts with a capital letter whereas first word starts with a lower case letter.
 *  (for instance helloWorld)
 *
 *  In node-opcua we have taken the opinionated decision to consistently use camelCase convention for
 *  object properties so that all the code look nice and consistent.
 *  the lowerFirstLetter method can be used to easily convert from the OPCUA  naming convention
 *  to javascript naming convention by applying the following rules.
 *
 *   * each ascii sequence in a identifier will be converted to lower camel case.
 *   * when an identifier only contains upper case letter then it will be untouched. ( i.e CQDF => CQFD)
 *     (this rules helps to preserve acronyms)
 *   * when a identifier starts with more than one UpperCase letter but still contain lowercase letter
 *     then the first Uppercase letter excluding the last one will be converted to lower case
 *     ( ie:  EURange = > euRange)
 *   * when a identifier contains several sequences delimited with underscores (_) the above rules
 *     will be applied to each of the element of the sequence
 *     ( ie: ALM_FlowOutOfTolerance => ALM_flowOutOfTolerance ( ALM=>ALM , FlowOutOfTolerance=>flowOutOfTolerance)
